This is an Animal Shelter Management System project where we can perform operations such as adding, deleting, updating, removing and searching on data.


The data was kept in a text file without any database. Instead of a ready-made data structure, a Linked List data structure created from scratch was used.

Data insertion process: The data we receive from the user is first added to the Linked List data structure, then the data structure is read and added to the text file. During this time, the received data is subjected to the validation process.


GUI was created in JavaFX language with CSS support.
