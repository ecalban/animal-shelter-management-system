This is an Animal Shelter Management System project where we can perform operations such as adding, deleting, updating, removing and searching on data.


The data was kept in a text file without any database. Instead of a ready-made data structure, a Linked List data structure created from scratch was used.


GUI was created in JavaFX language with CSS support.
